# hello-world
My first and brand new repository

Hi I am Stef and I'm interested in programming as a hobby. Long time ago I use to programm my Apple II in 6502 Assembler, basic applesoft, and Pascal UCSD... Time as as passed, things have changed a lot.
Now I would like to use Python for scrapping website, and others little things. And I've just discover iOs Workflow (futur shortcuts in ios12).
